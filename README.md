**Postdoc-phenology**

In this repository, you will find exploratory bibliometric analyses of meta-analyses and quantitative reviews on phenological changes (whether in plants or pollinating animals) and climate change (warming, changes in precipitation patterns, etc.). 

In the same repository, you will also find the database used to conduct these analyses.
